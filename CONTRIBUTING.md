## How to

This project use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) to manage different tasks and I created a **dev** folder to manage the Handlebars and the assets files.
All your changes should be made within the **dev** filder.
Running `grunt` will clean, copy and minify all the necessary files to the main directory.
